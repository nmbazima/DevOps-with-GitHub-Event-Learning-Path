
# DevOps with Github Learning Path

## Learning Path Description:
Tailwind Traders loves building software and working in the cloud.  Their team is growing and becoming more specialized.  In this learning path, you’ll work along with the Tailwind development and operations teams as they figure out how to work better together using DevOps patterns and practices.

## Sessions:

Listed below are 5 sessions and all resources associated with them so you can redeliver them in your technical community

There are no demos, however video recordings of demos have been provided

## [ADO10] Getting started with DevOps

### **Full Details:** [ADO10-description.md](/ADO10-description.md)

#### **Abstract:**
As teams grow, finding ways to effectively work together is vital. Communication across teams is challenging. We need to enable discovery of conversations and related information. Source code, scripts, configuration files, deployment docs and other related content also need to be centralized and versioned. Finally, teams need tooling that not only works across multiple project types and languages, but also facilitates remote-first collaboration.

#### **Attendee Takeaways:**
* Make communication centralized and discoverable.
* Everything that can be versioned goes in source control.
* Pick tools that support your team’s workflow – including source control, remote collaboration, and language and project types.

## [ADO20] Managing the Flow of Work

### **Full Details:** [ADO20-description.md](/ADO20-description.md)


#### **Abstract:**
DevOps is all about continuously delivering value. Before we can even begin thinking about CI/CD, we need to make sure we do the right work. Sprint after sprint, iteration after iteration, we need to plan our work and manage our workflows. 

This includes planning and tracking all units of work for the project. With frequent small iterations, there is no time to waste. Careful planning needs to happen to ensure the correct work gets done for each iteration. With the compressed time frame for each iteration, team members must work and coordinate their activities. Thus cross (functional) team visibility of work becomes vital for that coordination and allocation of resources. Visibility also ensures problems or bottlenecks get surfaced and addressed quickly. 

Managing source control changes are also important. We need to be in a deployable state at the end of every sprint. The main branch should be protected, yet changes being introduced should not be overly hampered and slowed down by the process. Being able to iterate quickly and safely is vital. 

And Finally, we need automation surrounding all our workflows to help enable everything as well as add consistency in what we do. 

#### **Attendee Takeaways:**
* Make work in progress visible with Azure boards. 
* Use trunk-based development to keep integration pain down and master ready to ship. 
* Automate your workflow to add consistency and remove drudgery.

## [ADO30] Building in Security and Quality

### **Full Details:** [ADO30-description.md](/ADO30-description.md)


#### **Abstract:**
Security and compliance are core concerns for organizations. Adopting DevOps practices and delivering software faster can increase those concerns. We can take steps to increase security and compliance as part of our DevOps lifecycle. 

#### **Attendee Takeaways:**
* Shift security left by enabling security at the earliest possible point. 
* Keep your container images current and be aware hidden dangers in base images. 
* Use infrastructure as code and policy as code to provide consistency in environments.

## [ADO40] Delivering Change to the Cloud

### **Full Details:** [ADO40-description.md](/ADO40-description.md)


#### **Abstract:**
The team at Tailwind Traders has a problem - they're still too dependent on manual processes and key individuals to bring their ideas to customers! While they have successfully implemented a raft of practices that result in trusted builds ready for deployment to the cloud, actually delivering the changes in an effective, trustworthy way is the next challenge. 

Tailwind Traders realises they need to automate their deployments, just as they automated their builds. It's important that they can deliver value quickly, but just as important they catch issues before they get to production with robust pipelines that can deploy to the variety of services their projects require. 

#### **Attendee Takeaways:**
* Deployment automation enables repeatability. 
* ChatOps and similar patterns enable control and automation. 
* Keep secrets in as few places as possible. 

#### **Resources:**

## [ADO50] Operating Software in the Cloud

### **Full Details:** [ADO50-description.md](/ADO50-description.md)


#### **Abstract:**
DevOps doesn't stop when you deploy. Incident response, identity management, and controlling access to production are all part of learning to run software well. 

#### **Attendee Takeaways:**
* For incidents to be effectively managed, someone needs to be responsible for responding. 
* No magic people or machines! Reduce the dependence on individual user accounts or environments with service principals and managed identities. 
* Use automation to deliver change into the environment – remove manual steps.
